% COIL DESIGN

@article{Turner1993,
abstract = {Methods of coil design for MRI gradient coils and other purposes are discussed. The conflicting requirements for satisfactory gradient coil performance are described and analyzed. Design methods are classified into discrete wire techniques and current density techniques. The advantages and disadvantages of each group of methods are described, and optimization methods are summarized. These include the target field approach, and constrained inductance and power minimization. Design for low fringe fields is described, including active shielding.},

abstract = {Attenuation of environmental low-frequency magnetic fields is important to reduce undesirable electromagnetic interference on electric and electronic equipment. This paper presents an analytical study of an active shielding arrangement to attenuate the 60 Hz magnetic fields produced by a transmission line at p points inside a cubic space. The shield consists of three sets of n orthogonal square coils, placed around the x, y and z-axes. Each coil is energized independently by a current source in such a way that all the B-x, B-y and B-z values detected at the p points, are cancelled when the set of coils generates opposite components. Computer simulation is performed to demonstrate the attenuation achieved and the current requirement for each coil. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

@article{Afach2014,
abstract = {The Surrounding Field Compensation (SFC) system described in this work is installed around the four-layer Mu-metal magnetic shield of the neutron electric dipole moment spectrometer located at the Paul Scherrer Institute. The SFC system reduces the DC component of the external magnetic field by a factor of about 20. Within a control volume of approximately 2.5 m × 2.5 m × 3 m, disturbances of the magnetic field are attenuated by factors of 5–50 at a bandwidth from 10 − 3 Hz up to 0.5 Hz, which corresponds to integration times longer than several hundreds of seconds and represent the important timescale for the neutron electric dipole moment measurement. These shielding factors apply to random environmental noise from arbitrary sources. This is achieved via a proportional-integral feedback stabilization system that includes a regularized pseudoinverse matrix of proportionality factors which correlates magnetic field changes at all sensor positions to current changes in the SFC coils.},

@article{Pandola2004,
abstract = {The final data of the Gallex and GNO radiochemical experiments have been searched for possible time modulations of the solar neutrino capture rate using the Lomb–Scargle periodogram and the maximum likelihood methods. Both analyses, performed using the raw data, do not support the presence of a time variability with characteristic periods resembling those of rotation of the solar magnetic fields, as previously suggested in the literature by some authors. In this context, the potential sensitivity of the Lomb–Scargle method to radiochemical 71Ga data has also been explored with simulated data. This allowed to set an exclusion plot in the frequency/amplitude plane from the Gallex–GNO dataset.},

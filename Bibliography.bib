abstract = {Methods of coil design for MRI gradient coils and other purposes are discussed. The conflicting requirements for satisfactory gradient coil performance are described and analyzed. Design methods are classified into discrete wire techniques and current density techniques. The advantages and disadvantages of each group of methods are described, and optimization methods are summarized. These include the target field approach, and constrained inductance and power minimization. Design for low fringe fields is described, including active shielding.},

abstract = {Attenuation of environmental low-frequency magnetic fields is important to reduce undesirable electromagnetic interference on electric and electronic equipment. This paper presents an analytical study of an active shielding arrangement to attenuate the 60 Hz magnetic fields produced by a transmission line at p points inside a cubic space. The shield consists of three sets of n orthogonal square coils, placed around the x, y and z-axes. Each coil is energized independently by a current source in such a way that all the B-x, B-y and B-z values detected at the p points, are cancelled when the set of coils generates opposite components. Computer simulation is performed to demonstrate the attenuation achieved and the current requirement for each coil. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

@article{Afach2014,
abstract = {The Surrounding Field Compensation (SFC) system described in this work is installed around the four-layer Mu-metal magnetic shield of the neutron electric dipole moment spectrometer located at the Paul Scherrer Institute. The SFC system reduces the DC component of the external magnetic field by a factor of about 20. Within a control volume of approximately 2.5 m × 2.5 m × 3 m, disturbances of the magnetic field are attenuated by factors of 5–50 at a bandwidth from 10 − 3 Hz up to 0.5 Hz, which corresponds to integration times longer than several hundreds of seconds and represent the important timescale for the neutron electric dipole moment measurement. These shielding factors apply to random environmental noise from arbitrary sources. This is achieved via a proportional-integral feedback stabilization system that includes a regularized pseudoinverse matrix of proportionality factors which correlates magnetic field changes at all sensor positions to current changes in the SFC coils.},

abstract = {The final data of the Gallex and GNO radiochemical experiments have been searched for possible time modulations of the solar neutrino capture rate using the Lomb–Scargle periodogram and the maximum likelihood methods. Both analyses, performed using the raw data, do not support the presence of a time variability with characteristic periods resembling those of rotation of the solar magnetic fields, as previously suggested in the literature by some authors. In this context, the potential sensitivity of the Lomb–Scargle method to radiochemical 71Ga data has also been explored with simulated data. This allowed to set an exclusion plot in the frequency/amplitude plane from the Gallex–GNO dataset.},

  abstract="This paper summarizes the results from measurements aiming to characterize ultracold neutron detection with 6Li-doped glass scintillators. Single GS10 or GS20 scintillators, with a thickness of 100-200$\mu$m, fulfill the ultracold neutron detection requirements with an acceptable neutron-gamma discrimination. This discrimination is clearly improved with a stack of two scintillators: a 6Li-depleted glass bonded to a 6Li-enriched glass. The technique of optical contact bonding is used between the two glasses in order to eliminate the need for optical glue or grease between them. Relative to a 3He Strelkov gas detector, the scintillator's detection efficiency is lower for UCN energies close to the scintillator's Fermi potential (85-100 neV), but becomes larger at higher UCN energies. Coupled to a digital data acquisition system, counting rates up to a few 105 counts/s can be handled. A detector based on such a scintillator stack arrangement was built and has been used in the neutron electric dipole moment experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute since 2010. Its response for routine runs of the neutron electric dipole moment experiment is presented.",

  abstract={The search for new significant peaks over a energy spectrum often involves a statistical multiple hypothesis testing problem. Separate tests of hypothesis are conducted at different locations over a fine grid producing an ensemble of local p-values, the smallest of which is reported as evidence for the new resonance. Unfortunately, controlling the false detection rate (type I error rate) of such procedures may lead to excessively stringent acceptance criteria. In the recent physics literature, two promising statistical tools have been proposed to overcome these limitations. In 2005, a method to ``find needles in haystacks'' was introduced by Pilla et al. [1], and a second method was later proposed by Gross and Vitells [2] in the context of the ``look-elsewhere effect'' and trial factors. We show that, although the two methods exhibit similar performance for large sample sizes, for relatively small sample sizes, the method of Pilla et al. leads to an artificial inflation of statistical power that stems from an increase in the false detection rate. This method, on the other hand, becomes particularly useful in multidimensional searches, where the Monte Carlo simulations required by Gross and Vitells are often unfeasible. We apply the methods to realistic simulations of the Fermi Large Area Telescope data, in particular the search for dark matter annihilation lines. Further, we discuss the counter-intuitive scenario where the look-elsewhere corrections are more conservative than much more computationally efficient corrections for multiple hypothesis testing. Finally, we provide general guidelines for navigating the tradeoffs between statistical and computational efficiency when selecting a statistical procedure for signal detection.}

@article{Cumming2004,
  abstract = {Radial velocity surveys are beginning to reach the time baselines required to detect Jupiter analogs, as well as sub-Saturn mass planets in close orbits. Therefore it is important to understand the sensitivity of these surveys at long periods and low amplitudes. In this paper, I derive analytic expressions for the detectability of planets at both short and long periods, for circular and eccentric orbits. I suggest an extension of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram for Keplerian orbits, and describe how to estimate the false alarm probability associated with a Keplerian fit. Using this to investigate the detectability of eccentric orbits shows that there are significant selection effects against eccentric orbits for e{\textgreater}0.6, and the small number of highly eccentric planets discovered so far may reflect this. Finally, I present a Bayesian approach to the periodogram, which emphasises the equivalence of least squares and periodogram techniques.},

  abstract={We present a novel study on the problem of constructing mass models for the Milky Way, concentrating on features regarding the dark matter halo component. We have considered a variegated sample of dynamical observables for the Galaxy, including several results which have appeared recently, and studied a 7- or 8-dimensional parameter space - defining the Galaxy model - by implementing a Bayesian approach to the parameter estimation based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The main result of this analysis is a novel determination of the local dark matter halo density which, assuming spherical symmetry and either an Einasto or an NFW density profile is found to be around 0.39 GeV cm −3 with a 1-σ error bar of about 7%; more precisely we find a ρ DM ( R 0 ) = 0.385±0.027GeVcm −3 for the Einasto profile and ρ DM ( R 0 ) = 0.389±0.025GeVcm −3 for the NFW. This is in contrast to the standard assumption that ρ DM ( R 0 ) is about 0.3 GeV cm −3 with an uncertainty of a factor of 2 to 3. A very precise determination of the local halo density is very important for interpreting direct dark matter detection experiments. Indeed the results we produced, together with the recent accurate determination of the local circular velocity, should be very useful to considerably narrow astrophysical uncertainties on direct dark matter detection.}

  abstract={The newly established luminosity functions (LFs) of high- z galaxies at4≲z≲ 10 can provide a stringent check on dark matter models that aim to explain the core properties of dwarf galaxies. The cores of dwarf spheroidal galaxies are understood to be too large to be accounted for by free streaming of warm dark matter without overly suppressing the formation of such galaxies. Here we demonstrate with cosmological simulations that wave dark matter, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/818/1/89/apj522251ieqn1.gif] {$\psi {\rm{DM}}$} , appropriate for light bosons such as axions, does not suffer from this problem, given a boson mass of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/818/1/89/apj522251ieqn2.gif] {${m}_{\psi }\geqslant 1.2\times {10}^{-22}\;\mathrm{eV}$} (2 σ ). In this case, the halo mass function is suppressed below ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/818/1/89/apj522251ieqn3.gif] {$\sim {10}^{10}\;{M}_{\odot }$} at a level that is consistent with the high- z LFs, while simultaneously generating the kiloparsec-scale cores in dwarf galaxies arising from the solitonic ground state in ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/818/1/89/apj522251ieqn4.gif] {$\psi {\rm{DM}}$} . We demonstrate that the reionization history in this scenario is consistent with the Thomson optical depth recently reported by Planck , assuming a reasonable ionizing photon production rate. We predict that the LF should turn over slowly around an intrinsic ultraviolet luminosity of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/818/1/89/apj522251ieqn5.gif] {${M}_{{\rm{UV}}}\gtrsim -16$} at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/818/1/89/apj522251ieqn6.gif] {$z\gtrsim 4$} . We also show that for galaxies magnified ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/818/1/89/apj522251ieqn7.gif] {$\gt 10\times $} in the HubbleFrontier Fields, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/818/1/89/apj522251ieqn8.gif] {$\psi {\rm{DM}}$} predicts an order of magnitude fewer detections than cold dark matter at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/818/1/89/apj522251ieqn9.gif] {$z\gtrsim 10$} down to ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/818/1/89/apj522251ieqn10.gif] {${M}_{{\rm{UV}}}\sim -15$} , allowing us to distinguish between these very different interpretations for the observed coldness of dark matter.}

  abstract={Very weakly interacting slim particles (WISPs), such as axion-like particles (ALPs) or hidden photons (HPs), may be non-thermally produced via the misalignment mechanism in the early universe and survive as a cold dark matter population until today. We find that, both for ALPs and HPs whose dominant interactions with the standard model arise from couplings to photons, a huge region in the parameter spaces spanned by photon coupling and ALP or HP mass can give rise to the observed cold dark matter. Remarkably, a large region of this parameter space coincides with that predicted in well motivated models of fundamental physics. A wide range of experimental searches — exploiting haloscopes (direct dark matter searches exploiting microwave cavities), helioscopes (searches for solar ALPs or HPs), or light-shining-through-a-wall techniques — can probe large parts of this parameter space in the foreseeable future.}

However, as has been known for a long time, in many string-based models, the axion coupling parameter F a is several orders of magnitude higher than the standard cosmological bounds. We re-examine this problem in a variety of models, showing that F a is close to the GUT scale or above in many models that have GUT-like phenomenology, as well as some that do not. On the other hand, in some models with Standard Model gauge fields supported on vanishing cycles, it is possible for F a to be well below the GUT scale.}

We show how the simplest approaches to moduli stabilisation give unacceptably large masses to the axions. We observe that solving the F-term equations is insufficient for realistic moduli stabilisation and give a no-go theorem on supersymmetric moduli stabilisation with unfixed axions applicable to all string compactifications and relevant to much current work. We demonstrate how nonsupersymmetric moduli stabilisation with unfixed axions can be realised. We finally outline how to stabilise the moduli such that f a is within the allowed window 10 9 GeV < f a < 10 12GeV, with f a ~ ( M SUSY M P ) 1/2 .}

The magnetometer relies on the detection of the free spin precession of nuclear spin polarized 3He by optically pumped cesium magnetometers. We characterize the relevant processes involved in the detection and quantify their impact on the total sensitivity of the magnetometer. An expression is derived that predicts the sensitivity of this magnetometer scheme and the results are compared to experiments. Excellent agreement is found between theory and experiments, and implications for an application of a 3He/Cs magnetometer in an experiment searching for a permanent neutron electric dipole moment are discussed.",

On a toroidal surface given as x vector = x vector ($\phi$,$\Theta$) ($\phi$ = toroidal coordinate, $\Theta$ = poloidal coordinate) the current filaments $\phi$ = $\phi$$\kappa$($\Theta$) are represented in terms of sin-functions. The paper includes several examples of classical stellarator and HELIAC configurations. By specifying a separate winding law for every single coil also WVII-AS type configurations can be modelled.

abstract = {Active magnetic shielding is a cheap and effective method for shielding magnetic noise that allows shielding the very low frequencies. In active magnetic shielding, it is possible to shield magnetic field sensor positions. However, there is a problem in which the shielding factor decreases at other positions. Also, the problem of cross-axial interference occurs when the magnetic field sensor cannot be installed at the center of the compensation coils, since the measurement object is installed at the center. In this study, an arrangement of the magnetic field sensors which solves these problems is proposed. This method installs pairs of magnetic field sensors symmetrically offset from the center along each axis. An experimental demonstration was carried out in a small model in order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our results show that a high shielding factor is obtained, even if the magnetic field sensor is not installed at the center.},

abstract = {MiniCLEANis a single-phase noble liquid scintillator experiment designed to detect nuclear recoils due to weakly interacting massive particles hypothesized to constitute the dark matter. The principle of the detector is to monitor scintillation light resulting from ionizing radiation using 92 photomultiplier tubes surrounding a spherical target. Photomultiplier tube response is known to be affected by sub-Gauss magnetic fields, so that the Earth's magnetic field has a non-negligible effect on the photomultiplier tube efficiency. In this experiment, the crucial nuclear recoil energy threshold depends on the ability to detect very small amounts of scintillation light; high photomultiplier tube efficiency is critical. Therefore, the MiniCLEAN collaboration has designed active compensation coils to mitigate the Earth's local magnetic field. Two features of the experimental environment make this situation unique: first, the underground laboratory (SNOLAB) is located in a nickel mine, so that direct measurement of the potentially distorted geomagnetic field is mandatory. Second, the close proximity of another experiment based on photomultiplier tubes (DEAP-3600) makes the compensating field outside our detector a concern. An additional complication is that MiniCLEANis surrounded by a steel water tank needed for shielding and a muon veto composed of four strings of 12 photomultipliers suspended in the water. We describe our design based on these considerations, survey data, field calculations and simulations of the photomultiplier tube response. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Spemann2003,
abstract = {As reported previously, slowly varying stray magnetic fields and, recently, additional 50 Hz fields deteriorate the lateral resolution in the low current mode of the high-energy ion nanoprobe LIPSION. Therefore, the active stray magnetic field compensation system AMK{\_}5 has been installed in the LIPSION laboratory. This system utilizes six coils in a Helmholtz-arrangement and advanced technology for magnetic field sensing and signal processing for its operation and allows to reduce the stray field fluctuations to excellent ±10 nT in all three directions for frequencies from true DC up to the kHz range. A compensation factor {\textgreater}100 was obtained for the vertical direction. The compensation system was also used to determine the sensitivity of LIPSION to stray magnetic fields. It was found that the sensitivity is largest for stray fields along the beam direction leading to a beam spot movement of 1.1 m/T in both horizontal and vertical direction. Thus, the residual stray field fluctuations of ±10 nT result in beam spot movements of ±13 nm assuming a homogeneous stray field and no contribution from stray fields outside the shielded volume. It is demonstrated that the lateral resolution of LIPSION is significantly improved by the active compensation system. However, there are still beam spot fluctuations in both vertical and horizontal direction dominated by 50 Hz components which limit the resolution in the low current mode to approximately 130 nm. The source of these fluctuations is still unclear. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper presents an analytical study of an active shielding arrangement to attenuate the 60 Hz magnetic fields produced by a transmission line at p points inside a cubic space. The shield consists of three sets of n orthogonal square coils, placed around the x, y and z-axes. Each coil is energized independently by a current source in such a way that all the B-x, B-y and B-z values detected at the p points, are cancelled when the set of coils generates opposite components.

abstract = {New results on an active stabilization system for improving the performance of a four-layer ferromagnetic shield are presented. The system is based on measuring the magnetic field outside (but close to) the shield by a fluxgate sensor. The output of this sensor is used to feed a current through an external coil system surrounding the shield, thus stabilizing the ambient external field in one direction at a predefined value. Here we report on the construction and the characterization of the system in the magnetic test facility at PSI with special emphasis on a potential future application in a measurement of the neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM). Because of the long integration times in the nEDM experiment (about 100s or more) only slow disturbances have to be corrected for. With stabilization, suppression factors around 200 have been observed for stationary, localized sources and for vehicles moving on a road at 10m distance. The ambient magnetic noise is reduced by a factor 10–20 for integration times of 100–1000s.},

Various active-loop configurations are proposed, which are analyzed in several regions located close to a particular MV/LV substation, and the optimum geometry and location of the loops are obtained together with the optimum current (magnitude and phase) to be injected into the loops. All this is performed by means of a genetic algorithm in order to reduce the average magnetic field inside the target volume (inspection volume) to the minimum. The performance of the proposed active loops is compared with that obtained via other well-known mitigation technique, such as conductive/ferromagnetic passive shields.

@article{Hudson2011,
abstract = {The electron is predicted to be slightly aspheric, with a distortion characterized by the electric dipole moment (EDM), d(e). No experiment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of particle physics predicts that d(e) is far too small to detect, being some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard model naturally predict much larger values of d(e) that should be detectable. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful way to search for new physics and constrain the possible extensions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c(2) (where c is the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity. The size of the EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interaction breaks the symmetry between matter and antimatter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of particle physics. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far, providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain d(e) = (-2.4 ± 5.7(stat) ± 1.5(syst)) × 10(-28)e cm, where e is the charge on the electron, which sets a new upper limit of |d(e)| {\textless} 10.5 × 10(-28)e cm with 90 per cent confidence. This result, consistent with zero, indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of precision. Our measurement of atto-electronvolt energy shifts in a molecule probes new physics at the tera-electronvolt energy scale.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. We report on the measurement of a Larmor frequency shift proportional to the electric-field strength for {\textless}sup{\textgreater}199{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Hg atoms contained in a volume permeated with aligned magnetic and electric fields. This shift arises from the interplay between the inevitable magnetic field gradients and the motional magnetic field. The proportionality to electric-field strength makes it apparently similar to an electric dipole moment (EDM) signal, although unlike an EDM this effect is P- and T-conserving. We have used a neutron magnetic resonance EDM spectrometer, featuring a mercury co-magnetometer and an array of external cesium magnetometers, to measure the shift as a function of the applied magnetic field gradient. Our results are in good agreement with theoretical expectations.},

@article{Kirschvink1992,
abstract = {A common mistake in biomagnetic experimentation is the assumption that Helmholtz coils provide uniform magnetic fields; this is true only for a limited volume at their center. Substantial improvements on this design have been made during the past 140 years with systems of three, four, and five coils. Numerical comparisons of the field uniformity generated by these designs are made here, along with a table of construction details and recommendations for their use in experiments in which large volumes of uniform intensity magnetic exposures are needed. Double-wrapping, or systems of bifilar windings, can also help control for the non-magnetic effects of the electric coils used in many experiments. In this design, each coil is wrapped in parallel with two separate, adjacent strands of copper wire, rather than the single strand used normally. If currents are flowing in antiparallel directions, the magnetic fields generated by each strand will cancel and yield virtually no external magnetic field, whereas parallel currents will yield an external field. Both cases will produce similar non-magnetic effects of ohmic heating, and simple measures can reduce the small vibration and electric field differences. Control experiments can then be designed such that the only major difference between treated and untreated groups is the presence or absence of the magnetic field. Double-wrapped coils also facilitate the use of truly double-blind protocol, as the same apparatus can be used either for experimental or control groups.},

\chapter{The nEDM active magnetic shielding}

\label{ch:nedm_sfc}

At the beginning of this section the principle of active magnetic field shielding is introduced. Then the system used at PSI for the measurement of nEDM is described, in particular its matrix-based feedback algorithm, which serves as an introduction to further Further, we elaborate on the properties of the matrix. Finally, the challenges for the design of a next-generation system for the n2EDM experiment at PSI are discussed, motivating the topic of the next chapter---a novel method of coil design.


\section{The principle of an active magnetic shielding}
Passive methods of shielding the magnetic field, like $\upmu$-metal shields, rely on magnetic properties of materials. In contrast, in active methods the disturbances are first detected, processed and then counteracted. It is not unlike the recently popular active-noise-cancellation headphones. Standard ones provide only passive damping of the ambient noise by covering the ears. Active headphones additionally feature microphones that resolve the profile of incoming sound, which is then inverted and emitted from the speakers. The two waveforms, when overlaid, cancel.

\end{figure}

Active magnetic field compensation systems follow the same principle. A volume, often called the fiducial volume, is encircled by coils, additionally to having magnetic field sensors distributed in it. It is schematically presented in Fig.\,\ref{fig:sfc-scheme}, taking the nEDM-at-PSI's system as the example: the fiducial volume is the violet structure in the middle, encircled by green dots depicting the magnetic field sensors. Around it there are three perpendicular Helmholtz-like pairs of coils, depicted in shades of orange. Variations of the magnetic field are detected by the sensors, an appropriate counteraction is calculated and sent into the coils.

Active shields do not substitute passive ones. The shielding factor
\marginpar{Shielding factor, measured in \si{\decibel} is the ratio of the power of the magnetic field as if it were not compensated to the compensated one.} of passive shields degrades by as much as \SI{40}{\decibel} (two orders of magnitude in amplitude) for frequencies slower than \SIrange[range-phrase = --]{1}{10}{\hertz}~\cite{Brake1991}. At the same time active systems perform best at DC and reach up to the kilohertz regime. The combination of the two shielding methods provides a stable magnetic field over the whole range of frequencies~\cite{Brake1991,Kelha1982,Voigt2013}.

Since 1980s numerous active magnetic field compensation systems have been built~\cite{Kelha1982,Brake1991,Spemann2003,Brys2005,Kobayashi2012,Voigt2013,Afach2014}. The applications span from ion beams, through bio-magnetism, all the way to nEDM measurements, in particular the one conducted at PSI\@.

% \note{Don't discuss it here: In the overlapping range of frequencies, where the two kinds of magnetic shielding could compete, the two advantages of the active shielding would certainly be the cost and accessibility of the enclosed volume.}



\section{The nEDM-at-PSI SFC system}
\marginpar{There was an inside joke that SFC really stands for SULTAN Field Compensation, SULTAN having been the magnet with by far the strongest influence on the magnetic field.}
The construction of active magnetic field compensation system for the nEDM measurement at the PSI, called the SFC (Surrounding Field Compensation) system,
was a part of Beatrice Franke's PhD thesis~\cite{Franke2013}, later also published~\cite{Afach2014}. The author of this work was responsible for maintaining the system, with the goal of gaining enough of understanding and experience to design a next generation system for the n2EDM experiment. In the beginning of this chapter the most important information about the SFC system is presented, followed by a few new insights. This serves as an introduction to the original developments, to which the remaining three chapters of part II are dedicated.

The distinct feature of the PSI's SFC system was the use of a feedback matrix. Consider a single coil of any shape in air. For every point in space, and for every spatial component, the magnetic field is directly proportional to the current in the coil. The SFC system had six coils and measured the field in nine points, three spatial components in each---27 channels. In total there were $6 \times 27 = 162$ proportionality constants, which were gathered in the feedback matrix $M$. The matrix $M$ was a property of the active compensation system, more precisely of the geometry of the coils and sensors. It could be calculated analytically, if not for the $\upmu$-metal shield, as ferromagnetic materials distort the magnetic field around them.

% Moreover, they make the system non-linear, which we are going to, for now, neglect.

% \note{Maybe some nice formula here for the matrix elements?}

The coils and the sensors are labelled as in Fig.\,\ref{fig:sfc-scheme}.}
  \label{fig:nEDM_SFC_matrix}
\end{figure}

\marginpar{A matrix-based feedback was first proposed by~\cite{RetaHernandez1998}. As their proposed system did not include $\mu$-metal, they could calculate the matrix analytically.}
To measure the matrix the following procedure was used: A current in one coil was scanned in steps over the whole available range, while the field change was measured with the sensors. Then for each sensor, and each spatial component, a linear regression was performed. The slope was the proportionality constant, the matrix $M$ element. The procedure was repeated of all coils. The matrix measured by Franke is depicted in Fig.\,\ref{fig:nEDM_SFC_matrix}.

The use of the matrix $M$ was what distinguished the PSI's SFC system from other systems~\cite{Kelha1982,Brake1991,Spemann2003,Brys2005,Kobayashi2012,Voigt2013}, which used either one component of a sensor, or a weighted combination of several components, to control one coil.



\section{The feedback algorithm}
The PSI's SFC system followed the established norm~\cite{Kelha1982,Brake1991,Spemann2003,Brys2005} and used a PID loop to control the currents. (PI in this particular case, the derivative term was not used.) The $j$th current in the $n$th iteration was~\cite{Franke2013}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:old_SFC_feedback}
  I^n_j = I^0_j +
    \underbrace{ \alpha^\mathcal{P}_j \, \Delta I^n_j }_\text{proportional term} +
    \underbrace{ \alpha^\mathcal{I}_j \, \sum_m \Delta I^m_j }_\text{integral term} \ .
\end{equation}

% $\Delta I^n_j$ is the error value in the current space. It was obtained by using the error value in the field space (the difference of the measured and target fields) and transforming it into the current space with the pseudoinverse of the matrix~\cite{Franke2013}:
\marginpar{The system, when started, was static. Then the currents could be changed manually to achieve a desired field (or chosen from a predefined set). Then the system was switched to the dynamic mode~\cite{Franke2013}.}
$\Delta I^n_j$ is the error value. It was obtained from the deviation of the measured and target field by multiplying it the pseudoinverse of the matrix $M$, denoted $M^\dagger$~\cite{Franke2013}:
\begin{equation}
  \Delta I^n_j = \sum_{k'} M^\dagger_{jk'} \, \Delta B^n_{k'} \ .
\end{equation}

Besides the proportional and integral terms, the feedback formula also included the $I^0_j$ term. It may seem puzzling to give such a big of a role to particular currents that had happened to be there at the zeroth iteration. It had to do with the property of the system, that the target field was always the one measured at the moment of switching the system from dynamic to static.
At that moment the error value was zero, and so was the integral term, so, according to the Eq.\,\ref{eq:old_SFC_feedback}, the output currents would immediately have switched to zero. In result, the system would violently destabilise. The additional term $I^0_j$ prevented that from happening.

Here we conclude the brief description of the system and proceed to present original insights of the author.



\section{Interpretation of the the feedback matrix}
There is a fundamental meaning behind the matrix $M$. The currents in the six coils can be gathered into a vector $\mathbb{I}$ in a space we call the \emph{current space}. Similarly, the 27 readouts of the magnetic field can be gathered into a vector $\mathbb{B}$ in the \emph{field space}. Then, the matrix $M$ provides the transition from the current into the field space. In particular, we have:
\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{B} = M \mathbb{I} + \mathbb{B}_\text{offset} \ .
\end{equation}
\marginpar{Finding the pseudoinverse of a matrix $A$ is equivalent to finding least-squares solution of a system of linear equations described by the matrix $A$ (although more computationally complex).}
Which is read: The measured values are a linear combination of the currents in the coils plus the ambient field.
The other direction, from the field to the current space, cannot be done exactly. Nevertheless, the optimal, in the least-squares sense, transition can be done with the use of the Moore--Penrose inverse (pseudoinverse) of the matrix $M$, denoted $M^\dagger$~\cite{penrose_1955}.
In other words, the matrix $M$ tells us what field, as measured by the sensors, will a given set of currents produce. The matrix $M^\dagger$ tells us, what currents to apply to best approximate a given field.



\section{The spectrum of the feedback matrix}
\label{sec:nedm_sfc_matrix}
The feedback matrix used during the data taking of the nEDM-at-PSI experiment (2014--17) was the one measured by Franke~\cite{Franke2013} (Fig.\,\ref{fig:nEDM_SFC_matrix}). This matrix not only needed to be inverted, but also additionally regularised.
% While it has been thoroughly discussed how to do the regularisation, the question of why was it needed at all was neither posed nor answered.

Let us elaborate on regularisation. The feedback matrix represents coefficients in a system of linear equations that need to be solved in order to make the optimal transition from the field to the current space. As the system of equations is over-determined, the best solution is found by the least-squares, which is equivalent to calculating the pseudoinverse matrix. A solution can be found reliably if the system is well-defined, i.e. the least-squares well is steep in every direction in the parameter space. If the well stretches, like a valley, in some directions, the solution is not globally well-defined, although it still may be defined up to a parameter (the one pointing in the direction of the valley). We then speak of an ill-defined set of equations, or an ill-defined matrix. Regularisation helps an ill-defined problem to become better defined, at the cost of the solution having larger sum of the residuals squared.

A real matrix $M$ may be decomposed into $M = U S V^T$, where $U$ and $V$ are unitary, and $S$ is diagonal (the \emph{Singular Value Decomposition} (SVD)~\cite{Golub1965}). The singular values lie on the diagonal of $S$, which is called the \emph{spectrum}. The spectrum of the feedback matrix is of uttermost importance. Pseudo-inverting a matrix with small singular values is an ill-posed problem. Similarily, as inverting small numbers.

One defines the \emph{condition number} of a matrix as the ratio of extreme values of its spectrum~\cite{Regression}. For a matrix with a flat spectrum, all singular values equal, the condition number is 1 and the set of linear equations this matrix represents is well defined. The more they differ, the higher the condition number and the worse defined the problem is. The effect is, that the noise in the original matrix becomes amplified by the condition number in the pseudoinverse.

Figure~\ref{fig:nEDM_SFC_svd} presents the spectrum of the PSI's SFC feedback matrix. First thing to note is that its condition number is $9.6 / 0.51 = 18.2$. A factor of 18 amplification of noise clearly explains why regularisation was necessary.

It is interesting to ask \emph{why} the system had an ill-defined feedback matrix. A very small singular value means that there exists a coil, or a combination thereof, which has about 18 times smaller influence on the field then others. In Fig.\,\ref{fig:nEDM_SFC_svd} the columns are the singular values with their corresponding coil-vectors. The first three, starting from the left, are easiest to interpret. Each of them is a pair of coils configured as Helmholtz-pair with roughly the same current, producing a homogeneous field in each of the spatial directions.
%The smaller singular value, or the effect on the field, in the Y direction is explained by the fact that this is the longitudinal axis of the μ-metal cylinder.
The last column has also a clear interpretation: it corresponds to all pairs configured as anti-Helmholtz, with currents flowing in the opposite directions. The magnetic field that was created by such a configuration was a complicated and very high-order. The fact, that this combination has so little influence on the measured field means, that it hardly changes any solution for currents when added upon it. It spans a valley in the parameter space in the least-squares problem. If not regularised, a small change in the measured field would cause a large change in the currents along the valley. Rapid oscillations in this direction would render the system unstable.

  {The coil-singular values of the SFC matrix. Columns correspond to singular combinations of the coils. For each column the corresponding singular value is indicated.}
  \label{fig:nEDM_SFC_svd}
\end{figure}

An important observation is that the feedback matrix is defined solely by the configuration of the coils, sensors and ferromagnetic materials. It follows, that already at the design stage one can, and should, take care about the definiteness of the system.

\section{Design challenges for n2EDM}
\label{sec:n2EDM_challenges}
Assume, that all there is to compensate are homogeneous fields. That is the zeroth order approximation concerning the space expansion of the magnetic field. To compensate them, a system needs to have coils that can produce a homogeneous field. Yet, the volume where the field of a coil system is homogeneous is limited. For example, in a case of a Helmholtz pair, the size of the volume where the generated field is homogeneous on a 2\% level is only around 0.4 that of the size of the coils. Increasing the relative size of the homogeneous volume requires more elaborate designs~\cite{Kirschvink1992}. When three Helmholtz pairs are used to compensate a homogeneous change, they only do so inside this limited volume. Outside, the field may even be more unstable, the extreme case being right next to the coils, where the field can get arbitrarily large. The situation is similar for any type of field: an active magnetic field compensation system can only stabilise the field in a limited volume.

% If a Helmholtz system were used to compensate a homogeneous change in the field, it would only do that where the field it creates would be homogeneous. Outside this volume, close to the wires, the field would actually be effectively destabilised (need to explain more, it may not be immediately clear, what I mean here).
% Near the wires a large field is created only to create the \emph{right} field inside.
% It follows that an active magnetic field compensation system can only stabilise the field in a limited volume. Outside this volume.

% The reasoning holds still if we consider fv


% An active magnetic field compensation system has a fixed set of coils. With them, it can only compensate these fields, which the coils can create. For example, it is natural to expect most of the variations in the field to come from sources that are far away, so that they are approximately homogeneous.
% To compensate them, the coils need to create a homogeneous counteracting field.
% Yet, for example, in a case of a Helmholtz pair, the size of the volume where the generated field is homogeneous on a 2\% level is only around 0.4 that of the size of the coils~\cite{Kirschvink1992}. It follows that, an active compensation system can only stabilise the field in a limited volume. Increasing the volume, while keeping the size of the coils constant, requires more elaborate coils~\cite{Kirschvink1992}.

  \caption{The original plan by Michael Meier highlighting the potential conflicts between coils of an n2EDM active magnetic field stabilisation system and other structures. First of all, the vicinity of the biological shielding (red) forced the coils to be designed relatively close to the magnetic shield (blue). Other bodies, like the support legs of the experiment, polarising magnet (orange) and an emergency exit from a nearby accelerator (red) gave additional constraints.}\label{fig:n2EDM_sfc_situational_plan}
\end{figure}

In the SFC the size of the coils was \SIrange[range-phrase = --, range-units=single]{6}{8}{\meter}, while the outermost $\upmu$-metal shield of the experiment was only around \SI{2}{\meter} large. In the next phase of the nEDM measurement at PSI, n2EDM, the passive magnetic shield is going to be \SI{5}{\meter} large and the experimental area can hardly accommodate larger coils (Fig.\,\ref{fig:n2EDM_sfc_situational_plan}). So for the design of the n2EDM's active shielding it was necessary to come up with coils that could produce a field they are likely to compensate in the whole volume occupied by the shield.

Unfortunately, no known design can be used because of spatial constraints. Some came from the experimental hall itself. For example an emergency exit from a nearby accelerator and a staircase leading to it (see Fig.\,\ref{fig:n2EDM_sfc_situational_plan}). Other constraints were due to higher-priority components of the experiment itself: legs on which the shield stands, the magnet used to polarise the neutrons, the neutron detection system, and the door of the magnetic shield.

The spatial constraints, together with the concern about ensuring a low condition number of the system, called for a in-depth investigation about the geometry of the future system's coils, which led to a new way to design magnetic field coils having been developed.

\chapter*{Conclusion} % Acknowledgements section text
Here conclude the whole work.

Remind why measuring the nEDM is interesting.

Why are magnetic fields important.

How active magnetic shielding helps. 

What was done for the active magnetic field shielding and what is the significance of it. Coil design method, allowed for\ldots A prototype showed\ldots A design proposed for the n2EDM active shield.

nEDM measurements could be used to detect dark matter. About the axions, one sentence. Then what was done and the results.

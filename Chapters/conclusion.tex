\chapter*{Conclusion}
The author of this thesis is a member of the collaboration.
He took part in the measurements and the work was concentrated on it.

Look somehow into the future\ldots nEDM will continue to be measured, but now it may apply the new techniques.

The new coil design method on a predefined grid made it possible to incorporate active magnetic shields in tight spatial constraints. It was demonstrated in a small-scale and a full scale design for the n2EDM shield was proposed. In active shields coils for high-order variations, even ones tailored for a particular source of a magnetic disturbance can now be designed with the new method.
The design for n2EDM. Maps...
It may also find its use in other areas.1

The search for axion dark matter with an nEDM experiment was the first of its kind. The ratio of the precession frequencies of stored neutrons and mercury atoms was checked for statistically significant, axion-induced oscillations. None were found, which resulted in the first laboratory limits for the axion coupling to gluons and an improvement on the ones on the axion-nucleon coupling. In the future a proposed resonant detection scheme may be used to use ultracold neutrons to search for heavier axions.

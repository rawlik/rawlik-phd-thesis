The twenieth century hass seen many particles being discovered. They all fit nicely together in the Standard Model of Particle Physics, most remarkable theory. It is summarised in Fig.\,\ref{fig:axions_SM_particles}.

Still, only an estimated 16\% of the universe is made of of matter known to us. We can explain all our immediate surroundings.

In contrast, the dark matter we can observe only on galactic scales via its gravitational interaction.

As early as 1884 Lord Kelvin has estimated the number of bodies in our Milky Way galaxy based on the velocity distribution and noted that most of them we do not see.

Over the next hundred years this approach, pioneered by Zwicky (ref) has been extended. Measuring the \emph{rotation curves} of the galaxies, the relation between the velocity of the stars in their motion around the galactic centre and the distance from it, provided a way to estimate the distribution of the mass. Gravitational lensing is another method.

It is the fundamental curiosity that drives the desire to understand what is Dark Matter made of.

We know that the Standard Model particles cannot build Dark Matter. They are either too light or interacting too strongly. Numerous models of Dark Matter have been proposed, most of them falling into two categories: Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions. Axions, in contrast to WIMPs, would be very light, but abundant.

Axions and WIMP are searched for with fundamentally different techniques. WIMP detectors, like XENON (ref) try to detect a single interaction signature of a WIMP particle with the mass of the detector. The detectors are massive, many tons, and almost background-free. In attempts to detect axions one looks for very weak signals coming from the omnipresent bulk axion matter.

We will focus on axions.





\section{Theoretical background}
Start with something about the $\theta_{QCD}$. What is the QCD axion? Why is it importnant? How were axions historically proposed?

Low-mass ($m_a \lesssim 0.1~\textrm{eV}/c^2$) axions can be produced efficiently via non-thermal production mechanisms, such as vacuum misalignment \cite{Preskill1983cosmo,Sikivie1983cosmo,Dine1983cosmo} in the early Universe. They fill the universe as almost stationary particles.

Through gravity axions participate in the galaxy formation. As they fall, they gain speed ($\approx \unit[300]{km/s}$, cite) and, being bosons, condensate into a coherent field.

The picture of the galaxies is that besides stars, if the axions were to make up all of dark matter, it is filled with a coherent axion field. The field oscillates with the frequency $\omega \approx m_a c^2 / \hbar$, where $m_a$ is the mass of the axion. This also sets an approximate limit for the axion mass. Their de~Broglie wavelength cannot exceed the size of the smallest observed Dark Matter structures. They would need to be heavier $\approx \unit[10^{-22}]{eV}$.

If axions would interact only gravitationally, there would be little chance to detect them is a laboratory. Fortunately, there is no reason not to expect that partake in other interactions, too. Searches assumed axions interacting electromagnetically. Typically they looked for axion-induced power deposited in a resonant cavity. The cavity can be tuned to particular frequency corresponding to an axion mass. The resonance greatly enhances the sensitivity of those experiments, but also limits it to a narrow range of frequency (mass). They require thus scanning, by retuning the cavity, to cover large mass-ranges.

Recently it has been proposed to look for different axion couplings, in particular to gluons and fermions.
\begin{align}
  \label{Axion_couplings}
  \mathcal{L}_{\textrm{int}} = \frac{C_G}{f_a} \frac{g^2}{32\pi^2} a G^{b}_{\mu \nu} \tilde{G}^{b \mu \nu}  - \frac{C_N}{2f_a} \partial_\mu a ~ \bar{N} \gamma^\mu \gamma^5 N \, ,
\end{align}

Low-mass ($m_a \lesssim 0.1~\textrm{eV}/c^2$) axions can be produced efficiently via non-thermal production mechanisms, such as vacuum misalignment \cite{Preskill1983cosmo,Sikivie1983cosmo,Dine1983cosmo} in the early Universe, and subsequently form a coherently oscillating classical field \footnote{Although non-thermal production mechanisms typically impart negligible kinetic energy to the produced axions, the gravitational interactions between axions and ordinary matter during galactic structure formation subsequently virialise galactic axions ($v_{\textrm{vir}}^{\textrm{local}} \sim 300$~km/s), giving an oscillating galactic axion field the finite coherence time:~$\tau_{\textrm{coh}} \sim 2\pi / m_a v_{\textrm{vir}}^2 \sim 2\pi \cdot 10^6 / m_a $, i.e., $\Delta \omega / \omega \sim 10^{-6}$. }:~$a = a_0 \cos(\omega t)$, with the angular frequency of oscillation given by $\omega \approx m_a c^2 / \hbar$, where $m_a$ is the axion mass (henceforth, we shall adopt the units $\hbar = c = 1$).
%\note{PMM: replace with ...classical field - a, $a=a_0 cos(wt)$, with the angular frequency of oscillations given by $\omega \sim m_a$, where $m_a$ is the axion mass.
%No need to mention $c=\hbar = 1$ as you've already used natural units before. Maybe you can mention in brackets: ... $\omega \sim m_a$ (in natural units). This is the first time $m_a$ is used so needs to be explicitly mentioned as the axion mass.}
The oscillating axion field carries the energy density $\rho_a \approx m_a^2 a_0^2 /2$. Due to its effects on structure formation \cite{Khlopov1985}, ultra-low-mass axion DM in the mass range $10^{-24}~\textrm{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-20}$ eV has been proposed as a DM candidate that is observationally distinct from, and possibly favourable to, archetypal cold DM \cite{Hu2000,Marsh2014,Schive2014,Marsh2015Review,Hui2017}.
The requirement that the axion de Broglie wavelength does not exceed the DM size of the smallest dwarf galaxies and consistency with observed structure formation \cite{Marsh2015B,Schive2015,Marsh2017} give the lower axion mass bound $m_a \gtrsim 10^{-22}$ eV, if axions comprise all of the DM. However, axions with smaller masses can constitute a sub-dominant fraction of DM~\cite{Hlozek15}.

It is reasonable to expect that axions interact non-gravitationally with standard-model particles.
Direct searches for axions have thus far focused mainly on their coupling to the photon (see the review \cite{Axion-Review2015} and references therein).

%\note{BL: We should cite: The here described experiment obtained a new limit on axion-like particles using ultracold neutrons \cite{Afach2015Exotic}.}
%\note{YS: In the earlier (long) version of this paper, we actually had a reference to this paper and several other papers on related applications of ultracold neutrons to look for new physics. In the process of shortening the paper, the paragraph containing these references was cut out, but perhaps we could restore the references somewhere in the paper.}
Recently, however, it has been proposed to search for the interactions of the coherently oscillating axion DM field with gluons and fermions, which can induce oscillating electric dipole moments (EDMs) of nucleons \cite{Graham2011} and atoms \cite{Stadnik2014A,Roberts2014A,Roberts2014B}, and anomalous spin-precession effects \cite{Flambaum2013Patras,Stadnik2014A,Graham2013}.
The frequency of these oscillating effects is dictated by the axion mass, and more importantly, these effects scale linearly in a small interaction constant \cite{Graham2011,Stadnik2014A,Roberts2014A,Roberts2014B,Flambaum2013Patras,Graham2013}, whereas in previous axion searches, the sought effects scaled quadratically or quartically in the interaction constant \cite{Axion-Review2015}.
%\note{PMM: needs citation, even if repeated with [27-31]}

In the present work, we focus on the axion-gluon and axion-nucleon couplings:
\begin{align}
\label{Axion_couplings}
\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{int}} = \frac{C_G}{f_a} \frac{g^2}{32\pi^2} a G^{b}_{\mu \nu} \tilde{G}^{b \mu \nu}  - \frac{C_N}{2f_a} \partial_\mu a ~ \bar{N} \gamma^\mu \gamma^5 N \, ,
\end{align}
where $G$ and $\tilde{G}$ are the gluonic field tensor and its dual, $b=1,2,...,8$ is the  color index, $g^2 / 4 \pi$ is the color coupling constant, {\color{black}$N$ and $\bar{N} = N^\dagger \gamma^0$ are the nucleon field and its Dirac adjoint,} $f_a$ is the axion decay constant, and $C_G$ and {\color{black}$C_N$} are model-dependent dimensionless parameters.
Astrophysical constraints on the axion-gluon coupling in (\ref{Axion_couplings}) come from Big Bang nucleosynthesis \cite{Blum2014,StadnikThesis,Stadnik2015D}:~$m_a^{1/4} f_a / C_G \gtrsim 10^{10}~\textrm{GeV}^{5/4}$ for $m_a \ll 10^{-16}~\textrm{eV}$ and $m_a f_a / C_G \gtrsim 10^{-9}~\textrm{GeV}^{2}$ for $m_a \gg 10^{-16}~\textrm{eV}$, assuming that axions saturate the present-day DM energy density, %$\bar{\rho}_\textrm{DM} = 1.3 \times 10^{-6}~\textrm{GeV/cm}^3$ \cite{Planck2015},
%\note{Maurits: I see that the dark matter energy density that is used on page 1 of the paper (1.3x10-6 GeV/cc) is very different than the number I normally come across (0.3 GeV/cc) for the direct DM searches. The paper does refer to the local DM density of 0.4 GeV/cc on the next page, but in the reference [1] I cannot find this number of 1.3x10-6GeV/cc. It could be that I overlooked something, as it is a rather chunky Planck collaboration paper that ref[1] refers to, but am I missing something?}
%\note{YS: These numbers refer to different things. The number $1.3 \times 10^{-6}$ GeV/cc refers to the present-day DM energy density that is averaged over the scale of the observable Universe, while the number 0.4 GeV/cc refers to the DM energy density in our local galactic region (which is averaged over a much smaller length scale of only about 0.1 - 1 kpc). Basically, the density of DM is much higher inside galaxies than it is outside of galaxies.}
%\note{GP, TL, DR: To calculate a limit on the Axionlike coupling strength from the limit on the oscillation amplitude of EDM one needs the local dark matter energy density.
%There is a debate in the dark matter literature on this value which is poorly known, however all dark matter experiments report limits using the "standard" value rho = 0.3 $GeV/cm^3$.
%See for example the latest Xenon1T paper arXiv:1705.06655v2
%I suggest we use the standard value instead of 0.4 $GeV/cm^3$. }
%\note{YS: The current Particle Data Group review on DM quotes the value $\rho \approx 0.4~\textrm{GeV/cm}^{3}$.
%I am told by other physicists that recent values of $\rho$ have hovered in the range $0.3 - 0.45~\textrm{GeV/cm}^{3}$, while older values in the literature hovered in the wider range $0.2 - 0.8~\textrm{GeV/cm}^{3}$. In either case, I do not know why the value $0.3~\textrm{GeV/cm}^{3}$ is quoted so frequently in experimental papers, since it lies towards the lower end of these ranges in both cases (even though we know, from consideration of the planetary orbits within our Solar System, that $\rho$ can be many orders of magnitude larger inside our Solar System than the local galactic average).}
and from supernova energy-loss bounds \cite{Graham2013,Raffelt1990Review}:~$f_a / C_G \gtrsim 10^6 ~\textrm{GeV}$ for $m_a \lesssim 3 \times 10^{7}~\textrm{eV}$.
{\color{black}Astrophysical constraints on the axion-nucleon coupling in (\ref{Axion_couplings}) come from supernova energy-loss bounds \cite{Raffelt1990Review,Raffelt2008LNP}:~$f_a / C_N \gtrsim 10^9 ~\textrm{GeV}$ for $m_a \lesssim 3 \times 10^{7}~\textrm{eV}$, while existing laboratory constraints come from magnetometry searches for new spin-dependent forces mediated by axion exchange \cite{Romalis2009_NF}:~$f_a / C_N \gtrsim 1 \times 10^4 ~\textrm{GeV}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-7}~\textrm{eV}$. }


The axion-gluon coupling in (\ref{Axion_couplings}) induces the following oscillating EDM of the neutron via a chirally-enhanced 1-loop process~%\footnote{Interaction (\ref{Axion_couplings}) also non-perturbatively induces a mass $m_a \approx 6C_G\,\mu\text{eV} \cdot (10^{12}\text{ GeV}/f_a)$.
%Axions with masses much smaller than this are theoretically fine-tuned.}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nEDM_axion}
d_\mathrm{n}(t) \approx +2.4 \times 10^{-16} ~ \frac{C_G a_0}{f_a} \cos(m_a t) ~ e \cdot \textrm{cm} \, .
\end{equation}
The axion-gluon coupling in (\ref{Axion_couplings}) also induces oscillating EDMs of atoms via the 1-loop-level oscillating nucleon EDMs and tree-level oscillating P,~T-violating intranuclear forces (which give the dominant contribution) \cite{Stadnik2014A,Flambaum1984EDM,*Flambaum1984EDMB}.
In the case of $^{199}$Hg, the oscillating atomic EDM is \cite{Stadnik2014A,StadnikThesis,Flambaum1985EDM,Flambaum1985EDMB,Flambaum2002EDM,Dmitriev2003A,Dmitriev2003B,Dmitriev2005,Engel2005,Engel2010}:
\begin{equation}
\label{199Hg-EDM_axion}
d_{\textrm{Hg}}(t) \approx +1.3 \times 10^{-19} ~ \frac{C_G a_0}{f_a} \cos(m_a t) ~ e \cdot \textrm{cm} \, ,
\end{equation}
which is suppressed compared to the value for a free neutron (\ref{eq:nEDM_axion}), as a consequence of the Schiff screening theorem for neutral atoms \cite{Schiff1963}.
%\note{KK: a question to our theory friends: Eqns. (2) and (3) suggest that $d_n$ and $d_\textrm{Hg}$ would have the same sign. Is this intended or are we rather talking about the modulus?}
%\note{YS: Yes, the same signs for $d_n$ and $d_\textrm{Hg}$ are intended here.}
%\note{MR: Should we explicitly point that out then?}
%\note{YS: I think this would be a good idea. We could explicitly add "+" signs in both Eqs. (2) and (3) to remove any ambiguity.}
%\note{CG: Might be good to comment that the Hg contribution is quite safely assumed to be negligible compared to the neutron for the purposes of this paper.}
The amplitude of the axion DM field, $a_0$, is fixed by the relation $\rho_a \approx m_a^2 a_0^2 /2$.
In the present work, we assume that axions saturate the local cold DM energy density $\rho_{\mathrm{DM}}^{\mathrm{local}} \approx 0.4~\textrm{GeV/cm}^3$ \cite{Catena2010}.




%Crucially, the constant amplitude of the axion DM field, $a_0$, is fixed by the known DM density at the location of the Earth, $\rho_{\mathrm{DM}}=\approx 0.4~\textrm{GeV/cm}^3$ \cite{Catena2010} (when reporting constraints on the couplings we assume axions make up all the local DM).


% Our experiment is also sensitive to the time-dependent energy shifts induced by the derivative coupling of an oscillating galactic axion DM field, $a = a_0 \cos(m_a t - \vtr{p}_a \cdot \vtr{r})$, with spin-polarised nucleons in (\ref{Axion_couplings}):
The derivative coupling of an oscillating galactic axion DM field, $a = a_0 \cos(m_a t - \vtr{p}_a \cdot \vtr{r})$, with spin-polarized nucleons in (\ref{Axion_couplings}) induces time-dependent energy shifts according to:
\begin{equation}
\label{potential_axion-wind}
H_{\textrm{int}} (t) = \frac{C_N a_0}{2 f_a} \sin(m_a t) ~ \vtr{\sigma}_N \cdot \vtr{p}_a \, .
\end{equation}
The term $\vtr{\sigma}_N \cdot \vtr{p}_a$ is conveniently expressed by transforming to a non-rotating celestial coordinate system (see, e.g., \cite{Kostelecky1999}):
\begin{align}
\label{sigma-p_a_2}
\vtr{\sigma}_N \cdot \vtr{p}_a  &= \hat{m}_F f(\sigma_N) m_a |\vtr{v}_a|  \notag \\
& \times \left[\cos(\chi) \sin(\delta) + \sin(\chi) \cos(\delta) \cos(\Omega_{\textrm{sid}} t - \eta) \right] \, ,
\end{align}
where $\chi$ is the angle between Earth's axis of rotation and the spin quantization axis ($\chi = 42.5 ^\circ$ at the location of the PSI), $\delta \approx -48 ^\circ$ and $\eta \approx 138 ^\circ$ are the declination and right ascension of the galactic axion DM flux relative to the Solar System \cite{NASA2014web}, $\Omega_{\textrm{sid}} \approx 7.29 \times 10^{-5}~\textrm{s}^{-1}$ is the daily sidereal angular frequency, $\hat{m}_F = m_F / F$ is the normalized projection of the total angular momentum onto the quantization axis, and $f(\sigma_N) = +1$ for the free neutron, while $f(\sigma_N) = -1/3$ for the $^{199}$Hg atom in the Schmidt (single-particle) model.

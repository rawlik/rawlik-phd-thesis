An active compensation system can only compensate those fields well, which its coil system can create. The question is


A mapping campaign is planned in the experimental hall, where the n2EDM experiment is going to be located. There are numerous magnetic sources in the vicinity of the site, causing the magnetic environment to be unusually complex. Taking a number of magnetic field maps will provide knowledge necessary to make sure, that the n2EDM compensation system will be able to cope with the environment. A 2.5m high mobile tower with 10 3-axis magnetic field sensors has been constructed. The position and orientation of the tower is measured with cable extension transducers, which makes the mapping process as simple as sweeping an area with the tower. Reproducibility of the maps measured with the device was proven to be better than \SI{0.5}{\micro\tesla}.

\section{The idea}
An essential input to designing the n2EDM active magnetic field compensation system was the scope of fields that would need to be compensated. There were numerous magnetic sources in the vicinity of the \note{mention the size of the hall} site, many of them dynamic, causing the magnetic environment to be unusually complex. Taking a number of maps of the magnetic field was planned to collect the information.

Speed was valued more than precision. The shorter it would take to map the field in the whole area, the less it would be influenced by varying external conditions. Also, the dynamics of the magnetic environment favoured taking multiple maps under different conditions, rather than few precise ones.
The implemented solution was a mobile tower equipped with magnetic field sensors at different heights, whose position and orientation could be measured while it was sweeping the area being mapped.

A small-scale prototype setup is pictured in Fig.\,\ref{fig:mapping_bastille_setup}. The tower
% is \SI{250}{\centi\metre} high and
has ten fluxgate magnetometers mounted on it. Behind the tower, in the corner, a rigid L-piece is visible. 
\marginpar{Other names for a string potentiometers include: cable-extension transducer, draw-wire sensor and string pot.}
It is carrying three black elements, string potentiometers, each with a thin wire coming out of it, the other end attached to the tower. Inside a string potentiometer the wire is wound on a spring-loaded spool, the spool attached to a potentiometer.
The potentiometer gives an analogue signal proportional to the extension of the wire. The combined information from the three sensors was used to determine the position and orientation of the tower.



\section{Principle of a string-potentiometer--based mapper}
For a known extension of a wire the set of points where the other end can be is a circle. The position and orientation determination is, in fact, finding the intersections of those circles.
\marginpar{Other position determination methods include triangulation (measurement of angles between lines connecting a set of fixed points) and multilateration (measurement of the differences of distances between a set of fixed points).}
In general, the problem of determining the location based on the measurement of the distance to a set of fixed points is called \emph{trilateration}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{gfx/mapping/geometry.pdf}
  \caption{The geometry of the mapper's position and orientation determination. In the orange coordinate system, the one of the `L-piece', the position of the centre of the tower, depicted as a thick black line, is $(x,y)$. The positions of the string-potentiometers used to determine the tower's position are $(0, y_0)$ and $(x_0, 0)$ and the extensions of their wires: $r$ and $\rho$. Another, green, coordinate system is depicted, in which the position of one of the string-potentiometers is $(0,0)$ and the other $(d, 0)$. The position of the tower in this coordinate system is $(\xi, \nu)$. There is also a third string-potentiometer, its string, length $\delta$, attached to the tower on an arm of a length $a$.}\label{fig:mapping_geometry}
\end{figure}

The geometry set by the circles is illustrated in Fig.\,\ref{fig:mapping_geometry}. The two string potentiometers used to determine the position are located is points $(x, y) = (0, y_0)$ and $(x_0, 0)$ (in the L-piece coordinate system, orange in the figure).
The wires of those two, their lengths $r$ and $\rho$, are connected to a single point $(x,y)$, lying directly on the vertical beam holding the sensors. We will refer to the point as the centre, even though it is not necessarily the geometric centre of the tower. The centre lies on the intersection of the corresponding circles.
For the sake of simplicity, we first give the solution for the centre's position in the coordinate system depicted in green,
% \note{maybe use the A B and C names here already}
where the first string potentiometer is in $(0,0)$, the second in $(d, 0)$, with
\begin{equation}
  d = \sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2} \ ,
\end{equation}
and the tower's centre is in $(\xi, \nu)$. Then: 
\begin{align}
  \xi & = \frac{1}{2d} \left( d^2 - \rho^2 + r^2 \right) \\
  \nu & = \pm\ \frac{1}{2d} \sqrt{ (-d + \rho - r) (-d - \rho + r) (-d + \rho + r) (d + \rho + r) } \ .
\end{align}
There are two solutions, symmetric around the line connecting the centres of the circles. Typically, though, it can be assumed that the tower never crosses the line.
The transformation of the solution to the `L-piece', orange, coordinate system is rotation by the angle 
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \mathrm{ctan}\, \frac{y_0}{x_0} \ ,
\end{equation}
followed by a translation:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    x \\
    y
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos \alpha & -\sin \alpha \\
    \sin \alpha & \cos \alpha
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \xi \\
    \nu
  \end{pmatrix}
  +
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    y_0
  \end{pmatrix} \ .
\end{equation}
The orientation is determined with a used of the third potentiometer, its string attached to the tower at a distance $a$ from its centre. Then, the position of the attachment point lies on the intersection of the circle centred at $(x,y)$, radius $a$, and one centred at the potentiometer, radius equal to the measured extension of the wire $\delta$. In this case there are also two solutions, but ambiguity could be avoided by keeping the orientation of the tower approximately constant.

In the prototype $x_0 = 0$. This had the consequence, that the precision of determining $x$ was poor, when simultaneously $y$ was large and $x$ small, as the circles intersected at a very small angle. Due to measurement noise and uncertainty in calibration (the relationship between the analogue signal and the extension of the wires) sometimes the circles did not intersect at all. In those cases, the middle point of the shortest line connecting the circles was taken as the solution.

\section{LPSC campaign}
\label{sec:lpsc_campaign}
The small-scale prototype setup was used to perform a mapping of the magnetic field of two rooms in Laboratoire de Physique Subatomique \& Cosmologie (LPSC) in Grenoble, France. The campaign took place in the days 6.-10.03.2017, with the much appreciated help of RÃ©mi Faure, Guillaume Pignol and Dominique Rebreyend. The rooms, referred to as \emph{Bastille} and \emph{Chalet}, were considered to host a magnetic-field sensitive setup for ${}^{199}$Hg magnetometry. Of particular interest were the gradients, which cause an increase in the depolarisation rate of the mercury atoms~\cite{FertlThesis}.
\note{In that case the gradients should be below roughly \SI[per-mode=symbol]{10}{\nano\tesla\per\centi\metre}, but I don't know why. Ask someone?}
% In particular, gradients above roughly \SI[per-mode=symbol]{10}{\nano\tesla\per\centi\metre} 

\marginpar{The string potentiometers were equipped with custom made attachments that allowed the string to come at an angle out of the device. The point where the strings bent was taken to be the middle of the circle in the geometry solution.}
A photograph of the mapping setup is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:mapping_bastille_setup}. The mobile \SI{2.5}{\metre} high tower was equipped with ten 3-axis fluxgate magnetic field sensors (Stefan-Mayer FLC3--70, the same as used in the active magnetic field stabilisation system).
The stationary `L-piece' held three string potentiometers (Micro-Eplison WDS-15000-P115-SA-P with \SI{15}{\metre} extension range).
The geometry parameters, as defined in Fig.\,\ref{fig:mapping_geometry}, were: $x_0 = 0$, $y_0 = \SI{1871}{\milli\metre}$, $a = \SI{623}{\milli\metre}$. The string-potentiometer for the orientation measurement was in the point $(\SI{1756}{\milli\metre}, 0)$.

% Two of the strings were attached to a point where the vertical beam with the fluxgates is, the third (left on the picture) was attached to the black, short vertical profile on the tower.

\end{figure}

The data acquisition system, pictured in Fig.\,\ref{fig:mapping_bastille_daq}, consisted of: a power supply that put a constant voltage (\SI{10}{\volt}) on the potentiometers; a custom-built crate for the fluxgates, which supplied them with power and conditioned the incoming signals; and a National Instruments PXI crate, which simultaneously digitised the analogue voltage signals from the fluxgates and the string-pots. The data were collected on a PC computer.

\end{figure}

A panoramic shot of the Bastille room is presented in Fig.\,\ref{fig:mapping_bastille_panorama}. The coordinate system is visible in the upper-left corner. To the right are the entrance door, in the middle, high on the wall, a power outlet box is visible.
% Behind the wall with the power outlet box there is a pump, which has been at some point removed.
The room was a wooden hut structure, built inside a hall made of steel beams and sheets. The room's wall with the power outlet on it was located close, less than 1 metre, to a steel wall of the hall. The hall was equipped a gantry crane, several metres above the roof of the hut.
% Directly on the roof there were air conditioning devices, standing about a metre above the roof on steel legs. The legs had rather large feet, possibly with a steel plate inside.

\end{figure}

To collect a map, the tower was moved around the room by one person, while another took care so that the readout cables did not get in the way.
\marginpar{The position was determined on-line. A display showed where the tower already has been.}
Care was taken to systematically scan the whole room and to maintain approximately the same orientation of the tower throughout the measurement. A track of one of the collected maps is depicted in Fig\,\ref{fig:mapping_bastille_track}. Note, that the centre of the tower could only go to a certain distance to the walls because of the the size of the tower's cart.
%\note{maybe mention, that the position was calculated on-line, too}
% Part of the data analysis is performed on-line. In particular the voltage readout of the string pots is translated into their lengths which are used to determine the position and orientation of the tower. This is to provide feedback during the measurements, necessary to make sure that the whole room was scanned. 
The data, the position and orientation of the tower, as well as the magnetic field measurements, were down-sampled and registered at \SI{50}{\hertz} rate.

On the ceiling there are small strong sources of the magnetic field and the colour scale is saturated.}\label{fig:mapping_bastille_magnitude}
\end{figure}



\section{Data treatment}
\label{sec:mapping_lpsc_data_treatment}
A map of the magnetic field is plotted in Fig.\,\ref{fig:mapping_bastille_magnitude}. Horizontal slices (each a different sensor) of the magnitude of the magnetic field are shown, with the height of the slice above the floor indicated. It is clearly visible, that there are localised sources of magnetic disturbance above the roof, later attributed to elements of an air-conditioning system mounted on the roof of the hut.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{gfx/mapping/lpsc/bastille_crane_away_rep_gradient_205cm_crop.pdf}
  \caption{A map of the gradients in the \emph{Bastille} room \SI{205}{\centi\metre} above the floor. Only the `horizontal' gradients (with respect to $x$ and $y$) have been estimated, as estimating the one with respect to $z$ would require comparing measurements between different sensors, whose intrinsic offset would dominate the result.}\label{fig:mapping_bastille_gradient}
\end{figure}

The measured information was also used to estimate the gradients of the magnetic field. To this purpose, the mapped area was divided into a $14 \times 14$ grid and the measurements were averaged in each bin.
Then, the differences between the magnetic field components in the neighbouring pixels were taken, which, divided by the separation between the bins, were the estimates of the gradient.
% For example, the $\partial B_x / \partial x$ gradient was estimated by the difference between 
The map of the gradient \SI{205}{\centi\metre} above the floor is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:mapping_bastille_gradient}.
% Comment on the structures from the roof? On the left side, next to the power outlet box, large gradients above \SI[per-mode=symbol]{20}{\pico\tesla\per\centi\meter} are visible.
Only `horizontal' gradients were estimated, ones with respect to $x$ and $y$.
To estimate the vertical ones, with respect to $z$, would require to compare the measurements of different sensors. The sensors were specified to be only $\pm 1\% \pm \SI{0.5}{\micro\tesla}$ accurate, which in a roughly \SI{50}{\micro\tesla} field adds up to a microtelsa. With a \SI{22}{\centi\meter} separation between the sensors, the systematic effect on the gradient would be \SI[per-mode=symbol]{45}{\nano\tesla\per\centi\meter}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{gfx/mapping/lpsc/reproducibility_field.pdf}
  \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{gfx/mapping/lpsc/reproducibility_gradient.pdf}
  \caption{Left: Reproducibility of the field, a histogram of the difference in the measured field. One entry is a difference along either $x$, $y$ or $z$. The width of the distribution is \SI{138}{\nano\tesla}. Right: reproducibility of the gradient estimation. One entry is a `horizontal' gradient estimate, with respect to $x$ or $y$. The width of the distribution is \SI[per-mode=symbol]{3.8}{\nano\tesla\per\centi\metre}.}\label{fig:mapping_bastille_reproducibility}
\end{figure}

Binned data allowed also for direct comparison between maps. In order to estimate the reproducibility of the mapping process two maps were taken directly one after another. The maps were then, after binning, subtracted. The histogram of the differences is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:mapping_bastille_reproducibility}. The standard deviation of the distribution, a measure of the reproducibility, is \SI{138}{\nano\tesla}. The reproducibility of the gradient was estimated in the same way, yielding the standard deviation of \SI[per-mode=symbol]{3.8}{\nano\tesla\per\centi\metre}. This is better than a na\"{\i}ve estimate, which assumes that the value of the component of the field measured in one, $\approx \SI{25}{\centi\metre}$ large bin has a \SI{140}{\micro\tesla} uncorrelated error bar associated with it:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\SI{140}{\nano\tesla} \, \sqrt{2}}{\SI{25}{\centi\meter}} = \SI[per-mode=symbol]{8}{\nano\tesla\per\centi\meter} \ .
\end{equation}
The reason is, that the for the absolute field estimate to be reproducible the system needs to be stable on a large time-scale, from one map to another. For the gradient of the field to be reproducible, the system needs to be stable only from one bin to the next.

\end{figure}

Also two maps taken in different conditions can be compared. Near the roof of the hall where the \emph{Bastille} hut was located there was a large gantry crane. In order to estimate the change in the magnetic field it inflicted when moving, two maps were taken: one with the crane in the far end of the hall and another with the crane directly above the hut. The maps were binned; their difference is plotted in Fig.\,\ref{fig:mapping_bastille_crane_change}. The magnetic field produced by the crane in the hut is about \SI{1}{\micro\tesla} strong half a metre above the floor, furthest from the crane, and rises to \SI{3}{\micro\tesla} at the hut's roof.
% Horizontally the change is homogeneous on a \ldots level.

The campaign at LPSC first of all resulted in a detailed magnetic characterisation of the Bastille and Chalet rooms, considered to be magnetometry laboratories. (The maps of the Chalet rooms can be found in App.\,\ref{ch:chalet_appendix}.) Second of all, it demonstrated the capabilities of the magnetic field mapping with a mobile tower, whose position and orientation is determined with string potentiometers. The prototype was later enlarged in preparation for mapping of a much larger volume, one where the n2EDM experiment was to be built.



\section{PSI Area South campaign}
The mapping of the Area South in the UCN hall at PSI, the location of the nEDM and n2EDM experiments, took place in the days 19.12.2017--12.01.2018. In that time the area was empty---the nEDM apparatus had already been disassembled and a reinforced concrete foundation for the n2EDM experiment had been laid.
% After the n2EDM apparatus would be set up it would occupy the area and no magnetic mapping will be possible.
The goal of the mapping campaign was to characterise the magnetic field environment, in particular the different fields created by nearby magnets.
The information would provide the information necessary to design an active system, that would efficiently compensated for those fields.
The mapping campaign was a joint venture with Solange Emmenegger and Jochen Krempel.
% \marginpar{The mapping took place in the days 18--22.12.2017 and 2--12.01.2017.}
% Acknowledge that it is a joint work with Solange Emmenegger and Jochen Krempel.

% First say about the area - how large, refer to a picture.
\marginpar{The total weight of the n2EDM shield is 47 tons.}
The prototype mapper used in the LPSC campaign was extended to its full-scale. The Area South, pictured in Fig.\,\ref{fig:mapping_photo}, is about \note{get the info} large.
The $5 \times 5 \times \SI{5}{\metre}$ magnetic shield of n2EDM would reach up to \note{info}. In the full-scale setup the arms of the `L-piece' were \note{info} long and the tower was \SI{8}{\metre} high.
\marginpar{The tower was built out of aluminum trusses, typically used for stages.}
An additional magnetic field sensor directly above the floor was added. Other than that, no changes from the prototype were made. The string potentiometers, the magnetic field sensors and the data acquisition system remained the same.

% The mapper used in the LPSC campaign needed to be enlarged, so that it could map the whole volume in the Area South.
% The volume to map was much larger then it was the case in the LPSC campaign. and the device needed to be enlarged. The `L-piece' was enlarged to \ldots. The tower was \SI{8}{\metre} high. An additional sensor was added directly above the floor. The other elements, string potentiometers, magnetic field sensors and DAQ, remained the same. \note{get the geometry}
% Then say what kind of mapper was necessary to map that. Most of the hardware kept, just made larger.
% The Area South is pictured in Fig.\,\ref{fig:mapping_photo}. It is roughly \note{GET THE SIZE} in size. The n2EDM magnetically shielded room, $5 \times 5 \times \SI{5}{\metre}$ large itself, ends \note{the height}.

% Now about the magnets - COMET, SULTAN and COBRA. SULTAN daily ramps, COBRA and COMET just one ramp. Many maps and then combination thereof.
There were three strong magnets close to the area: COMET, SULTAN and COBRA\@. COMET is a medical cyclotron located several meters into the concrete biological shielding on the far-side wall in Fig.\,\ref{fig:mapping_photo}. Its field, very inhomogeneous due to the vicinity of the source, was around \SIrange[range-phrase=--,range-units=single]{10}{50}{\micro\tesla} strong. COMET is very rarely turned off. Fortunately, during the mapping campaign there was scheduled power-cut, for which the cyclotron was ramped down. SULTAN is a superconducting magnet for material research, located around \SI{15}{\metre} away from the site. It ramps daily, creating a roughly \SI{50}{\micro\tesla} field in the area. COBRA is a magnet located in a neighbouring experimental hall. The strength of its field is around \SI{5}{\micro\tesla}.

In total 25 maps were taken with various combinations of the states of the magnets. The maps are summarised in Tab.\,\ref{tab:psi_mapping_maps}.
As of April 2018 the analysis of this maps in ongoing~\cite{EmmeneggerThesis}.
The procedure of binning and subtracting the maps (Sec.\,\ref{sec:mapping_lpsc_data_treatment}) will allow the field of each of the three magnets to be estimated. The measurements will be an important input to the design of the n2EDM active magnetic field compensation system. They will help to decide coils corresponding to which of the cartesian harmonics should be built. Maybe coils dedicated for a particular high-order disturbance, like COMET, will be designed based on the maps.

\section{Conclusion}
The prototype at ETH, described in Ch.\,\ref{ch:sfc-prototype}, has demonstrated an active magnetic field compensation system with an unprecedentedly large fiducial volume. Thereby it constructively shows, that an active magnetic field compensation system for the n2EDM experiment can be built.

The maps of the magnetic field at the site of n2EDM provide a crucial input to the design of the coils of the active compensation system. The design can be done fully within the framework of the new coil design method, the topic of Ch.\,\ref{ch:coil_design}.

The developments of this work lay the foundation for an active magnetic field compensation system for the n2EDM experiment, which would reduce the tens-of-microteslas variations down to just a few.

\chapter{Mapping}
A mapping campaign is planned in the experimental hall, where the n2EDM experiment is going to be located. There are numerous magnetic sources in the vicinity of the site, causing the magnetic environment to be unusually complex. Taking a number of magnetic field maps will provide knowledge necessary to make sure, that the n2EDM compensation system will be able to cope with the environment. A 2.5m high mobile tower with 10 3-axis magnetic field sensors has been constructed. The position and orientation of the tower is measured with cable extension transducers, which makes the mapping process as simple as sweeping an area with the tower. Reproducibility of the maps measured with the device was proven to be better than 0.5ÂµT.

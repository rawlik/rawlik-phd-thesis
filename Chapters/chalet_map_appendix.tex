\chapter{Maps of the Chalet room at LPSC}
\label{ch:chalet_appendix}
The ``chalet'' room at LPSC in Grenoble, France, was mapped with the prototype of the mapper (see Ch.\,\ref{ch:mapping}). A panorama of the room is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:mapping_lpsc_chalet}. Figure~\ref{fig:mapping_lpsc_chalet_magnitude_map} shows the map of the magnitude of the field. A large dipole source is visible to the right, which was attributed to a large radiator, visible on the photograph below the window on the far wall.

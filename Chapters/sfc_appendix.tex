\section{Visualisation of the data}
A typical question for the SFC data: I see the field changing. How does the field that induced this change look like?

Why difficult? First, the fluxgates only measured the field already compensated---the sum of the external field and the one created by SFC's coils. Three dimensional field in a three dimensional space. The field is deformed by the $\upmu$-metal shield. And the interesting field is often relative (magnet ramped, its field is the difference between after and before the ramp).

The solution was to create an interactive tool to visualise and explore the SFC data.

The overview can be seen in Fig.\,\ref{fig:nEDM_SFC_visualisation1}. There are two plot areas, upper in the time domain, lower can be switched between a 3D geometrical representation and a second time-domain plot. The loaded set of data, spanning 18-20 Nov 2015, shows a ramp of the SULTAN magnet. The ``field to display'' setting is set to ``calculated external field'', given by:
\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{B} - M \mathbb{I}
\end{equation}
Another option is displaying the measured field $\mathbb{B}$.
In the first part the field points in the $x$ direction (North) and 45 degrees downwards (Villigen is 47 degrees in latitude). As expected for the Earth's magnetic field. On the upper plot there is a vertical yellow line, a movable cursor, that chooses which point in time is depicted in the 3D visualisation. There it visualises what is more-or-less the Earth's magnetic field at the experiment's position.

In Fig.\,\ref{fig:nEDM_SFC_visualisation2} two cursors, blue and yellow, are used simultaneously to juxtapose the ``calculated external field'' before and after the ramp. In Fig.\,\ref{fig:nEDM_SFC_visualisation3} the ``difference mode B-A'' has been turned on. In the bottom plot we observe the SULTAN ramp relative to the field before the ramp. This is the field of the magnet as seen in the experiment site. In Fig.\,\ref{fig:nEDM_SFC_visualisation4} this field is visualised graphically, pointing South-East.

\note{Maybe show the field of COBRA, too!}

The program is cross--platform (Windows, OSX, Linux), fully based on open--source softwore. It is written in python and uses the following libraries: Qt4 (cross-platform GUI), pyqtgraph (fast interactive plotting), VTK (3D graphics) and SciPy (data handling). It is a joint work with Nils Ebeling, for whom it was a summer project.

Although it is very technical, it is very easy to underestimate the role of having data exploration tools at hand while the experiment is running.



\section{Performance during SULTAN ramps}
Another task was to compare the SFC performance in shielding SULTAN ramps in 2015 and 2016. From a rather quick look at the data it seemed that the field inside the apparatus, as seen by the Hg comagnetometer and Cs magnetometers, was affected more strongly by the ramps in 2016 than in 2015.

% ((ext_field - B_Earth) * B_SULTAN)
The first is to determine the times of the ramps. Unfortunately, those data are not easily available. But could be calculated from the SFC data.

We define $\mathbb{B}_\text{Earth}$ as the uncompensated field ($\mathbb{B} - \mathbb{M} \mathbb{I}$) when the SULTAN magnet is known to be off. We then define the field of the SULTAN magnet to be $\mathbb{B}_\text{SULTAN} = \mathbb{B} - \mathbb{M} \mathbb{I} - \mathbb{B}_\text{Earth}$, when the magnet was known to be on. Then we can calculate the content of the SULTAN in the field by projecting the uncompensated field, minus the Earth's, on the one of the SULTAN:
\begin{equation}
  \left( \mathbb{B} - \mathbb{M} \mathbb{I} - \mathbb{B}_\text{Earth} \right) \cdot \mathbb{B}_\text{SULTAN}  
\end{equation}

  {\ldots}
  \label{fig:finding_SULTAN_ramps}
\end{figure}

The value of this projection for two weeks in May 2016 is depicted in Fig.\,\ref{fig:finding_SULTAN_ramps}. The SULTAN ramps are wonderfully pronounce and their times easy to get, as the times when the projection crosses 0.5 going up (ramp up) or down (ramp down).

  \caption{Magnetic field of the SC magnet seen by the SFC. Taken as difference of runs...}
\end{figure}

With the exact times of the SULTAN ramps available, the Hg comagnetometer and Cs magnetometer data in a 2h window around each of the ramps were taken. From the Cs data the gradient was estimated as the difference between the averages of the top and bottom sensors, divided by the separation of \SI{25.1}{\centi\meter}. The change was defined as 0.9 and 0.1 quantile difference. The histogram for all the field changes, as measured by the Hg, during SULTAN ramps is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:SULTAN_ramp_Hg_performance}. It is visible that while in 2015 the changes are consistently around \SI{34}{\pico\tesla}, in 2016 the changes are centred around \SI{55}{\pico\tesla}.

\note{Look once again into the data, try to see what the peak is.}

\note{Write that the scheme may be more generally used?}

Conclusion: reason is unknown, but the incentive to find it out is not to strong. Changes in the field are compensated by the Hg magnetometer. The uncompensated vertical gradient change remained the same.






% \section{Influence of the SC magnet}
% The ultracold neutrons are polarised by passing through a superconducting magnet. The length of the path of the neutrons to the experiment should be small to minimise transport losses. For this reason the experiment is located close to the exit of the UCN beam--port and the magnet is fit in between.

% The improvement in the range of the field is 40-70\% (In different simulated runs, 21.7 to 12.6 (42\%), 22.2 to 12.9 (42\%), 19.3 to 5.8 (70\%), and 35.1 to 18.6 (57\%)), unit microteslas.


\section{Magnetic field during sparks in HV}

\note{Push it into an appendix?}

This is important! As clearly the most dangerous magnetic fields are ones correlated with HV.

The resistor to limit the current. It is a spiral of chained small resistors, submerged in cooling oil.

\end{figure}


Fortunately, HV was very stable during the data taking and sparks hardly ever happend.

\note{How can I learn how often we had sparks?}
